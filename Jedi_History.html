        <h1>The Beginning of the Order</h1>
        <p class="card_story">The Jedi Order, also known as the New Jedi Order under Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, was a
            noble monastic and nontheistic
            religious order united in their devotion to the light side of the Force. They served as mediators, warriors,
            and with
            teaching and exploratory efforts. With a history dating back thousands of years before the rise of the
            Galactic Empire,
            the Jedi Knights—noted for their lightsabers and natural ability to harness the powers of the Force—stood as
            the
            guardians of peace and justice in the Galactic Republic. The Order was originally established on Ahch-To in
            the Unknown
            Regions. In later years, the Jedi Grand Temple on the Core World Coruscant served as the hub of all Jedi
            activity in the
            galaxy. The Temple was also a training school for younglings and Padawans, who learned the ways of the Force
            under the
            supervision of Jedi Masters, twelve of whom were elected to serve on the Jedi High Council—the Order's
            highest governing
            authority. The High Council's staff officers were the Grand Master, who functioned as the leader of the
            Order and was a
            title reserved for the wisest Jedi Master, and the Master of the Order, who served as the Council's
            appointed leader.
            The Jedi Code governed the Order's way of life; therefore, every Jedi was duty-bound to observe and uphold
            the Code or
            else risk expulsion from the Order.</p>
            <img src="img/RandomJedi.png" alt="photo random of a jedi">

        <p class="card_story">The emergence of the Sith Order was the result of a schism that fractured Jedi unity,
            dividing the Order between the
            Jedi who remained faithful to the light and a group of renegades that followed a rogue Jedi into exile for
            exploring the
            dark side of the Force. Thenceforth, the Jedi and Sith warred with each other for centuries. Although the
            last conflict
            concluded with the fall of the Old Republic, the ancient Sith all but perished as well, allowing a new
            Galactic Republic
            to rise under the protection of the Jedi Order. Unknown to the Jedi, however, the Sith endured in secret for
            a
            millennium beginning with Darth Bane, the sole-surviving Dark Lord of the Sith who reformed the Sith way by
            creating the
            Rule of Two—a rule limiting the Sith Order's ranks to two members: a Sith Master to embody the power of the
            dark side,
            and a Sith apprentice to covet that power. While the Jedi and Republic moved on, their ancient wars with the
            Sith fading
            from memory, Bane's legacy spawned a lineage of Sith Lords that culminated in the rise of Darth Sidious
            approximately
            three decades before the Battle of Yavin.</p>

        <p class="card_story">During the final decades of the Republic, the Jedi Order vowed allegiance to the Galactic
            Senate as the galaxy was besetDuring the final decades of the Republic, the Jedi Order vowed allegiance to
            the Galactic Senate as the galaxy was beset
            by political instability and social unrest which, in turn, created a secessionist crisis that ultimately
            resulted in the
            formation of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Lacking the sufficient manpower needed to protect the
            galaxy, the
            Jedi became commanders and generals in the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic. For roughly three years
            they
            commanded armies of clone troopers in a conflict known as the Clone Wars, engaging the Confederacy's battle
            droid forces
            led by Count Dooku—a former Jedi Master who became a Sith Lord—and the cybernetic warlord General Grievous.
            Though the
            Jedi fought to preserve the Republic, the government they served was secretly taken over by Sidious who, as
            Senator
            Sheev Palpatine of Naboo, rose to power in the Senate and became the last Supreme Chancellor of the
            Republic. The Jedi
            were unknowingly being deceived by the Sith.</p>

        <p class="card_story">The Chancellor's deceptions and machinations culminated in the execution of Order 66, a
            secret protocol that forcibly
            turned the Jedi's clone soldiers against them, leading to an all but total extermination of the Jedi Order.
            With most of
            the Jedi eliminated, Sidious supplanted a thousand years of democracy with a new government known as the
            Galactic
            Empire. In addition, Sidious succeeded in turning Anakin Skywalker—the prophesied Chosen One who was
            destined to bring
            balance to the Force by destroying the Sith—to the dark side and renamed him Darth Vader. As a Sith Lord,
            the former
            Jedi Knight served the self-proclaimed Galactic Emperor by hunting down the few surviving Jedi, who had gone
            into hiding
            across the galaxy. In spite of the Sith's efforts, however, the Jedi continued to endure. Within a
            generation of the
            Empire's rise to power, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda—both of whom survived the initial purge of the Order—trained
            Vader's
            son, Luke Skywalker, in the Jedi arts. Luke would later redeem his father, causing the redeemed Anakin
            Skywalker to
            return to the light and fulfill his destiny as the Chosen One, destroying both himself and his Master during
            the Battle
            of Endor.</p>

        <p class="card_story">The precursors of the Jedi were the
        <h3>Dai Bendu</h3><img src="img/Bendu.png" alt="photo de Bendu">, but the Jedi Order itself was founded in the distant past on planet
        Ahch-To by the Prime Jedi around 25,025 BBY. According to the legend, Force-imbued swords were used prior to
        invention of the lightsaber by the earlier Force adepts and the Jedi Order. At the dawn of their order, the
        Jedi came into possession of Ilum, an ancient planet encased in ice and littered with kyber crystals, the heart
        of the
        Jedi lightsaber. Considered the Jedi Order's most sacred world, its ancient Temple would eventually host the
        Gathering,
        a tradition that would continue up until the fall of the Order. As the Jedi were spread throughout the galaxy,
        they
        acquired a vessel called the Crucible that would ferry students to Ilum so that they could perform the
        Gathering. It
        would become the base of the architect droid, Professor Huyang, for over a thousand years as he instructed on
        lightsaber
        designs and kept records of every single Jedi weapon created. During this early period, the Order also
        established itself on Ossus, Jedha, Xenxiar, and other worlds. Later, some Jedi scholars argued that a number of
        locations could be considered the birthplace of the Order. The scholars argued that Coruscant, Jedha, and Ossus
        as well
        as worlds shrouded in myth, such as Tython and Ahch-To could all be considered candidate worlds for the Order's
        birth
        and the location of the first Jedi temple.</p>

        <p class="card_story">The Jedi religion, as it was called by Luke Skywalker, was based around eight "sacred
            texts" that "describe tenets,
            history, and specific guidance to those studying the path of the Jedi." These texts included the Rammahgon
            and the
            Aionomica—separated into two volumes, Aionomicum I and Aionomicum II. These books included a number of
            aspects of the
            Jedi religion that appeared to have little influence on later Jedi, such as references to "gods" and the
            World Between
            Worlds. They also included more mundane information, such as lightsaber designs. The theology of the Jedi
            religion
            changed over time; many Jedi, such as Master Odan-Urr, annotated even the sacred texts. Much was added to
            the Jedi canon
            over time, giving rise to the belief that the Aionomicum II doubled in size during its compilation.</p>

        <p class="card_story">At some point prior to around 20,000 BBY, a Jedi sect known as the Ordu Aspectu broke off
            from the Jedi Order. Led
            by the enigmatic Rur and his second in command, Amon, they sought to achieve the secrets to immortality.
            Eventually, a
            conflict broke out between them and the orthodox Jedi. The conflict ended with the signing of a peace
            treaty. The treaty
            allowed the Ordu Aspectu to continue their research but under Jedi scrutiny. During his experimentation, Rur
            attempted
            to copy his intellect into his citadel's computer core, only to accidentally transfer his very sentience as
            well. When
            the Jedi sought to investigate the computer closer around 20,000 BBY, the computer activated the citadel's
            security droids, killing all members of the Ordu Aspectu and Jedi alike; but not before it was deactivated
            by Rur and
            Amon before they died themselves, thus ending the Ordu Aspectu.</p>
